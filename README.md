# score-to-chat

-This tool is for people who have a song on their mind but don't quite remember the title and want to try AI/LLM's ability to recognize songs.

-I provided a run.cmd script that you shall grab and drop either .py script on it to run them. It's a simple `python %*` command wrapped in a .cmd .

-You can erase wrong notes with the backspace button.

-You can replay previous scores with score-it-back.py

-You compose with score-it.py

-Finally, you copy the scores to clipboard and paste it in any llm chat window
